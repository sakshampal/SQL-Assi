    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a collection of books in a library, and each book has a unique barcode.\n",
    "In a database, a primary key is like that unique barcode for each row (or record) in a table. \n",
    "It's a special column that uniquely identifies each entry in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key points about a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column must be unique within the table. Just as no two books in the library\n",
    "can have the same barcode, no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unchanging: The primary key value should typically never change, or if it does, it should be\n",
    "a rare event. This is similar to how a book's barcode doesn't change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index: Databases often create an index on the primary key column to speed up searches, \n",
    "making it efficient to find specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a \"Students\" table, each student might be assigned a unique student ID as \n",

    "Now, imagine you have two separate lists: one for books borrowed by library members and another\n",

    "the member who borrowed each book. This reference is a foreign key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key points about a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship: A foreign key establishes a connection between two tables in a database. \n",
    "It specifies that the values in one column (the foreign key) are related to the values\n",
    "in another column (the primary key) in a different table.\n",

    "Referential Integrity: Foreign keys help maintain referential integrity, ensuring that the\n",
